# SmartLivenessProxy
A smart proxy which allows liveness probes for internal apps

## PROBLEM

Just like we have alerts/notifications when any of our externally running apps goes down; we would like to have alerts/notifications for internal supporting apps e.g. Jenkins, Kibana, etc.

## SOLUTION

The idea is to build a smart proxy which dynamically creates endpoints that allows to JUST probe the health endpoints of internall apps. 

## STATUS

TODO
